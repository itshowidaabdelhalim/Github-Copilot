#### Github-Copilot is such a great helper for the beginners and help the ones that get stucked into a problem
# My Experience with Github-Copilot
#### Github-Copilot solves problems but not in a specific way you want the problem to be solved.
#### I wanted A fractel pattern by astrieks in a specific way, but it did a function not printing the way of astrieks in the shape I want.
#### But printed the astrieks in another form.
